# NEA-analysis-PyQt5
custom electrophysiology data processing UI built in pyqt5 (deprecated). Written for labmates ~2019. 

There was some interest in having a UI for analyzing electrophysiology data recorded from custom nanoelectrode arrays, specifically for intracellular action potential recordings. I was in the middle of building this when people expressed a preference for having a UI based in MATLAB's GUI builder instead. 

the detect_peaks.py function was taken from [Marcos Duarte](https://github.com/BMClab/BMC/blob/master/functions/detect_peaks.py).

Requires [McsPyDataTools](https://pypi.org/project/McsPyDataTools/) to be installed.
